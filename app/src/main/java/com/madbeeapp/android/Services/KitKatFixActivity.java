/* KitKat introduced a new bug: swiping away the app from the 
 * "Recent Apps" list causes all background services to shut 
 * down. To circumvent this issue, this dummy activity will 
 * launch momentarily and close (it will be invisible to the 
 * user). This will fool the OS into thinking that the service 
 * still has an Activity bound to it, and prevent it from being 
 * killed.
